# Sample-Website-Project

This is a simple website course project that mocks what an online beverage and snack store would look like. I tried to create it in a 90s looking theme. HTML, JS, and CSS was used to created this website. The code also shows the use of different html elements, including iframe, maps, forms, etc.  Images citations are included within HTML code.

The main index.html is inside the pages directory. 

Here is a snippet (partial) of the what the main page looks like (index.html):

And a snippet (partial) using iframe and form (homework7.html and homework9.html):
